*ai3*
=====

The *ai3* (Algorithmic Innovations for Accelerated Implementations of
Artificial Intelligence) framework provides easy-to-use fine-grain algorithmic
control over an existing *DNN*. The framework contains built-in high performance
implementations of common deep learning operations and methods by which users
can implement their own algorithms in *C++*. The framework incurs no additional
performance overhead, meaning that performance depends solely on the algorithms
chosen by the user.
