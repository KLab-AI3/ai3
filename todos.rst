- backpropagation is very slow need to implement a custom method
- groups and padding modes for convolution implementations
- adaptiveavgpool2d where output dim isn't multiple of input dim
- add attention support similar to the current convolution
- examine impact of caching queue for SYCL then maybe use context

Publishing
~~~~~~~~~~
- documentation for both the framework and CPP library
- host HTML on github pages not sure how that works since repo not public
- add homepage information, docs, to pyproject.toml
- should have an example of an actual sped up example
